This module contains scenes, actors, macros, to re-interpret the classic Traveller adventure, Shadows, for the [Twodsix module](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/twodsix/), based on the original adventure published in the early 1980s. The players are tasked with the investigation of a pyramid structure on the surface of a mostly unexplored planet with a toxic atmosphere.      

Note this adventure is 'not ready to run'. This module includes GM only notes ( on the Journal tab in the Foundry UI ) with instructions and suggestions to help the GM prep the adventure. The GM only notes also cover other considerations such as vacc suit damage rules which were not included in the published adventure, converting the adventure from the classic Traveller for use with other systems such as Cepheus, as well specific scene notes. 

The GM also requires a copy of the published Traveller adventure Shadows for the adventure background information and location descriptions within the pyramid structure to be able to run this adventure.  
 
Note the actors in the adventure have been pre-configured for use with the cepheus light ruleset. The GM has the option to reconfigure the adventure to use one of the rule systems supported by the Twodsix module. ( In Foundry game settings > configure game settings > twodsix.  
For more details refer [Twodsix system configuration guide](https://github.com/xdy/twodsix-foundryvtt/wiki/System-Configuration-Guide). If the GM chooses to use a rulset other than cepheus light the GM must reconfigure the actors, both players and non players, in terms of stats and equipment. The [Twodsix discord](https://discord.gg/KUAwPrj) is also suggested as a resource to GMs for assistance.  

The intent of this adventure, besides re-interpreting Shadows for use with Foundry VTT, is to provide the basis for GM's new to Foundry ( and/or Twodsix ), as a short, small scale adventure to learn and build skills and confidence with Foundry VTT, as did I the module author, through developing this module, with the help and support of others in the Foundry community ( the official Foundry and Twodsix discords, the [Foundry subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Foundry), the [Foundry wiki](https://foundryvtt.wiki/) etc ). By design I limited the use of 3rd party modules to a minimum to help both myself, and others starting out that want to use this module. For example use of the levels module in Foundry in of itself is already complicated. 
There is scope for GM's once they have become confident with Foundry to modify this adventure and / or use other modules to improve gameplay or graphical effects such animations etc.  

This modules is fan made unofficial and provided free for use with Foundry VTT. The published Traveller adventure Shadows on which this module is based is copyright of ~~[FFE](https://www.farfuture.net/)~~ TODO insert the correct Mongoose and / or Creative Commons license? 

Installation instructions. 

1. Install the twodsix game system in Foundry
2. Install the twodsix-shadows-adventure module in Foundry 
3. Create a new empty world and select twodsix as the rules set. NOTE I suggest the GM not put shadows in the world name so players will not know what the adventure is. 
4. Launch the empty world 
5. From the game setup menu click on manage modules and check the box for the twodsix-shadows-adventure in the module management dialog. 
6. Wait for the world to refresh
7. From the compendium menu click the twodsix shadows adventure compendium
8. From the open compendium click the twodsix shadows adventure. 
9. Click the import adventure button on the adventure: twodsix-shadows-adventure dialog 

NOTE Foundry will install the latest version of all module dependencies ( for e.g. levels, monks active tiles etc ). For this reason it is necessary that the GM prep the adventure and play test the scenes and run tokens through the levels, test out the scene teleports and macros etc. ( for example the levels module may have issues with fog of war for players that change levels within a scene, for more information refer GM journal notes on scenes. )    
NOTE that the Twodsix module will install using the default settings, including the UI blue on black default UI theme /style. I suggest the GM configure the Twodsix module display settings to use the Foundry standard style as the blue text on black background is can be hard to read clearly, especially if editing tiles to be able to read what the tile actions / triggers are ).
